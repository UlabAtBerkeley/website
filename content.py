                        This year, we are following a replicate and extend structure. Mentees will be divided into groups of 4-5 and assigned a mentor that will guide them through a year-long project. The first semester will be spent replicating a published study and the second semester will be spent extending the methods based on an original idea. The studies will be provided through a database compiled by the ULAB executive team. Each group will get to pick studies in areas that interest them the most! This will also allow an opportunity for projects to be published! This year we will also have grad student support for all groups.
                        <p><p/>
                        Our projects this year involve social psychology, fMRI analyses, visual field cortices, language processing, and more. All projects will be published in a paper and poster series via UC eScholarship Open Access publishing.

On a technical level, this involves introducing students in our group to underlying processes associated with research â€” namely, programming and performing statistical tests. Our program, however, extends beyond coursework. With the help of experienced undergraduate mentors, we guide students through a research project of their choosing over the course of an academic year by helping them make sense of the current literature, isolate a feasible project, and execute projects on a reasonable timescale. In doing so, we provide students with the opportunity to expand their interests and provide mentors with leadership roles within the research community.</p>

                        The Data Science Lab, started by Alan Pham in Fall 2018, is a great opportunity for students to conduct data science research by working on an interesting project, with guidance from experienced undergraduate mentors. It might seem difficult, but itâ€™s actually very fun and easy, because of our unique way of providing students a gentle introduction to research. For mentors, this is a meaningful opportunity to lead aspiring researchers while getting to know what it might be like to lead a lab. <br/>

                        <br/>

                        Data science is becoming an increasingly important field, and the ability to understand, analyze, and clearly communicate data is valuable in any field, so we encourage everyone to study it. Projects can be about anything you choose, as long as it deals with data. Possible areas of interest could be education, business, technology, health, sports, sociology, government, etc. Basically, anything you learn about or observe in life can be analyzed with data science, so this is a great chance for students of all majors to explore any research topics of their interest. For example, you could investigate factors that increase risk for certain diseases, develop a predictive model for election results, or identify factors that increase school test scores. This is a very beneficial and worthwhile opportunity, and we hope you can join as a researcher or mentor. <br>

What if we separate the engineering from the science? ATG is a full-blown organization dedicated to doing just that. More specifically, ATG is an augmented intelligence group that combines human-centered design, data science, and software development to help improve the efficiency of laboratories around the UC Berkeley campus and within ULAB itself. We are currently developing projects and curriculum for the upcoming semester in order to immerse students interested in software development immediately in the quickly-growing field."

            <h4>Astrophysics</h4>
                <p>The Astrophysics branch of uLab provides an academic outlet for first-year students with an interest in space physics, exoplanets, cosmology, and much more, regardless of their intended majors. While Astrophysics uLab functions as a gateway to classes and research opportunities for those who decide to pursue astrophysics research in the future, those who do not will leave the program with the benefits of a broad range of academic skills, research experience, and an heightened understanding of basic astrophysics.</p>
                <p>In this sense, uLab welcomes passionate students more than anything else. From those determining their interest in a major to those to those already sure, uLab Astrophysics is a great place to improve research paper literacy, experimental design and computer programming skills, in addition to participating in the epicenter of important interdisciplinary discoveries.</p>
                <p>The astrophysics branch currently supports two separate projects, the first being on exoplanetary atmospheric analysis. By using open-sourced data from NASAâ€™s Kepler mission, the group plans to create an automated method of categorizing various exoplanetâ€™s atmospheric compositions and habitability likelihood.</p>
                <p>The second of the astrophysics projects focuses on black holes. By comparing the results of an existing research paper making use of RELXILL with those calculated from the new FENRIR model, students will examine black hole spins and hone computational skills.</p>
            <h4>Condensed Matter</h4>
                <p>The Condensed Matter branch of uLab allows students with an interest in atomic and molecular physics to investigate the mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of nanomaterials and nanostructures. Students who join the condensed matter team will learn about the various techniques and methods that are prevalent throughout the field. We work closely with research groups in the physics department. Current areas of research at Berkeley are quantum information, physics of nanomaterials, magnetism, quantum materials, optical properties, photoemission, superconductivity, and new materials. Our undergraduate mentors are involved in various condensed matter research groups, and can share their experience in the field as they guide students in their projects.</p>
                <p>Given the interdisciplinary nature of the field of condensed matter, students from various majors, such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and engineering are welcome to join. Students interested in developing applicable research skills, such as learning how to write research papers, being introduced to working in a laboratory environment, and professional development are invited to pursue independent research with our undergraduate mentors.</p>
                <p>The condensed matter branch of uLab is currently running projects in graphene deposition and high-temperature superconductors. In the graphene project, we compare two chemical vapor deposition techniques. Between both growth methods, we will compare the prevalence of surface defects and deformations in graphene, and the yield and quality of growth.
            <h4>Particle Physics</h4>
                <p>The uLab Particle Physics Group allows first-year students interested in particle, nuclear, and high-energy physics to learn about the research community at Berkeley while performing new research in fundamental physics. This semester, the particle physics group is investigating the possibility of active cosmic ray shielding using magnetic fields in order to reduce the noise in precision particle physics experiments. The group will be constructing a particle detector and measuring the reduction in particle intensity when different shielding designs are used. In the process, students will also learn about statistics and data analysis as well as software commonly used in the particle physics. An effective shield will allow the group to pursue other precision experiments without the interference of cosmic rays.</p>
