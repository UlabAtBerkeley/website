                    <h4>Motivation</h4>

                    <p> 
                        The educational aim of this group is to prepare students to tackle the hardest problems in molecular biology. There are two difficulties in starting research in molecular biology. 
                        The primary challenge is access to common laboratory equipment. 
                        Without common access to equipment (such as PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, etc.), many students find themselves unable to contribute to any part of lab operations.
                        Some of the students we surveyed cited lack of access to laboratory equipment as a primary reason for why they were unable to train themseleves for wet laboratory positions.
                        This uLab is partnering with several biomedical research facilities on campus and at UCSF to provide access to all common laboratory equipment for students to be trained for all of the common technical procedures done in a molecular biology laboratory.
                        The second difficulty is that "wet labs" by defintion are any research that is not primarily computational. The sheer breadth of research interests and techniques make it difficult for students to articulate how they envision participating in biology research. 
                        Through partnerships with many laboratories on campus, and through a cadre of dedicated experienced student researchers, we guide students through a survey of major labs and techniques and help define what "wet laboratory research" they are most passionate about. 
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        The research aims of this uLab are in particular focused on synthetic chemistry, genomics (both computational and proteomics), and neurobiology (via medical imaging).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Research Questions</h4>

                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li> What are novel drug delivery techniques used to deliver novel genetic therapies? </li>
                        <li> How does your genetics play a role in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases? </li>
                        <li> What are the biological principles behind common blood tests? Can these tests be optimized to provide cheaper alternatives to the larger Berkeley area? </li>
                        <li> What are common synthetic techniques used to construct drugs such as Claratin? </li>

                    </ul>
