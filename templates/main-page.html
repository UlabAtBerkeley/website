                            Undergraduate Lab @ Berkeley is an undergraduate lab that was created by students, for students. We offer workshops, seminars, lab tours, and research opportunities at our student-run lab. ULAB strives to revolutionize the playing field by providing gateway for new students to gain a foothold in research on campus.

                        When Berkeley undergraduates engage in immersive research experiences, it can be one of the most transformative and fruitful adventures of their college career. Yet, many new students are deterred from even getting started. This problem stems from a tendency for programs to favor already experienced students and difficulty for new students in navigating a complex myriad of Berkeley resources.&nbsp;ULAB emphasizes new ways to reach underrepresented and socioeconomically disadvantaged students by partnering with the residence halls and existing organizations. -- Big Ideas @ Berkeley</p>
